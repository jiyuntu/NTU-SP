- The program is tested on linux workstation (linux1)
- It'll be better if you can run
```
bash auction_system.sh [n_host] [n_player] 2>&-
```
to remove the stderr. I have eliminated all the output on stderr I used for
debugging, but I'm afraid that the shell script will prompt out
some unexpected error message.
